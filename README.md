# Basic Image Mainupulation
# This program involves baisc image manipulation. 
# Getting the image to scale up and down
# Getting a rotated and mirrored image of the image
# uploading an image on a blackboard background using the Red, Green, Blue pixel values
# getting the negative of the image. 

# I hope to do include more functions to do with image manipulation, especially inluding more varitey of colours
# also some of the ouput image comes a bit blurry in relative to the original image and this problem should also be solved
